  <p>The SkyTruth alert system is a free service open to the public that provides daily updates of environmentally significant incidents by     geographical area.  You can browse the most recent incident reports on a map or in Google Earth, and you can also subscribe to a personalized     feed of incident reports via RSS or email</p>

  <p>The alert feed currently contains reports generated from ongoing SkyTruth investigations, combined with selected reports from the the National Response Center that have been processed by SkyTruth's automated expert system to clean up problem data and add additional SkyTruth commentary and analysis.</p>
